# Phase III: Prototypes and User Testing

By Karandeep Dhillon and Tamanna Haider for Team Fridge


# Methods
We used our prototypes to conduct **User testing**. User testing allows us to observe how real-life users interact and feel about how our product. It also allows us to know if our product is working in the way we intended, identify usability problems, and how to solve those problems. We had our participants(n=5) answer some questions and complete two tasks using our prototype. We began with background questions such as Do you use any websites or apps designed to keep track of food waste or ingredients? Do you manually keep track of food waste/ingredients? how often do you go grocery shopping? How much do you spend on each grocery trip on average? how many people are in your household? and if reducing food waste and keeping track of ingredients was something they have been wanting to do. After the background questions, the first task our participants had to complete was adding an item to a table and finding an expired item to delete. Our second task was to update the information on an existing food item and find a soon-to-expire food item to delete. Though these tasks seem similar and simple, we gained valuable insights into how real-life users would complete these tasks because there were multiple ways of completing each task. We closed up the user testing with a few wrap-up questions. The wrap-up questions included Were there any moments where the website gave you troubles, and you could not figure out what to do? Were there any features of the website that stood out to you or that you particularly liked? Are there any additional features you wished the website had? and Do you have any other thoughts or comments? Each user test took a maximum of 30 minutes and all participant information was confidential. 

# Findings
**Background questions**
* Do you use any websites or apps designed to keep track of food waste or ingredients? 
  * All 5 of our participants reported that they do not use any website or app designed to keep track of their ingredients. 
 
* Do you manually keep track of any food waste or ingredients?
  * 3 out of the 5 participants reported that they do manually keep track of their ingredients. When asked how they go about manually keeping track, they revealed that they used the Notes app or used pen and paper to keep track when they checked their fridge.
  * When ask if they would find a digital way of keeping track of food items to be easier, they said yes with one participant saying that if there was an app for their phone then yes. 
* How often do you go grocery shopping?
  * 4 out of 5 participants reported once or twice a week. One participant concluded that someone else shops for them. 
* On average, how much do you spend each trip to the grocery store?
  * 2 out of the 5 participants reported they spent around 30 dollars on each trip. One participant reported, "it varies." One participant reported around 130 dollars and another participant reported 150 dollars. 
* How many people live in your household/are involved in cooking and groceries?
  * 4 out of the 5 participants reported 1 as their household number with one participant reporting 4 as their household number.
* How often do you eat out?
  * One participant reported 2 to 3 times a week and another one reported 4 times a week. One participant reported 2 times a month and another participant reported, "more than I would like." One participant reported once a week. All our participants reported very different answers. 
* Which of the statements is the most true for you? 1. I want to minimize the amount of food that goes bad/gets thrown away 2. I want to budget groceries better 3. I want to find ideas on what to cook based on what I have in my fridge.
  * 4 out of the 5 reported "I want to minimize the amount of food that goes bad/gets thrown away" to be the statement that is most true to them with one participant answering "I want to find ideas on what to cook based on what I have in my fridge."
 
 **Task 1** 
 * added the ingredient?
     * All 5 participants were able to complete the task. However, all 5 participants could not find the "add item" button and it took them all greater than 20 seconds to locate the "add item" button at which they had an "aha" moment. 
 * deleted the correct expired ingredient?
     * 4 out of the 5 participants were able to complete this task seamlessly. The one participant who did not correctly complete the task found that decreasing the quantity to 0 would result in deleting the task but the item was not deleted. 
 * 1-5 scale where 1 is very difficult and 5 is very easy
     * 2 out of 5 participants reported 5 with the other three reporting 4. The ones that reported a score of four all concluded it was because they found the add item button to be difficult to locate.
   
**Task 2** 
* changed ingredient?
  * All 5 participants were able to complete this task.
* deleted correct soon-to-expire ingredient?
  * All 5 participants were able to complete this task.
* 1-5 scale where 1 is very difficult and 5 is very easy
  * 4 out of the 5 participants gave this task a score of 5 with one participant giving it a 4.

**Wrap up**
* Were there any moments where the website gave you troubles, and you could not figure out what to do?
   * One participant reported, "Not really, just the "valid from" and "valid to" on the form for adding an item were not clear. Also, the photo shouldn't be required or there should be a default album you can choose from."
   * Another participant answered, "No, easy to understand, learnable, memorable"
   * Another participant was a little confused on whether the food item represented food items currently in their fridge or if it was a shopping list for when they go shopping
   * One participant said "no, nothing" and another said "couldn't find add item button"
* Were there any features of the website that stood out to you or that you particularly liked?
   * All participants said the status of each food item and the layout and design of the webpage was what they liked. Along with these, the notifications icon was also liked by one participant.
* Are there any additional features you wished the website had?
  * 2 out of the 5 participants simply replied "none." One participant said "make pictures option" and another participant said, "autoupdate expiration would be nice." One participant said they would like recommended recipes from the food items. 
* Do you have any other thoughts or comments?
  * 3 out of the 5 participants said "no" with one participant saying "you guys did a great job" and another participant saying "not sure why the notifications are jumping."
  
# Conclusions
From our user tests and findings, we can conclude that our project/prototypes require a few changes but overall our application is easy to use, understandable, and useful. From our back questions, we able to gave insights on whether people keep even track of their food items either digitally or manually, how much they spent on each trip and how often they go. Most of our participant did want to keep track of their food items and reduce food waste. From our tasks, we gained insights on what we could improve and change to make our able easier, more useful, and more compelling to users. To our surprise, we had found that all our participants struggled to locate the "add item" button since it took them a couple of a minute to add a food item to the table. We plan on fixing this issue by making the button bigger, maybe changing the color, and maybe the location of where the button is.
