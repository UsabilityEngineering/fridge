# Phase III: Prototypes and User Testing

By Karandeep Dhillon and Tamanna Haider for Team Fridge


# Methods
We used our prototypes to conduct **User testing**. User testing allows us to observe how real-life users interact and feel about how our product. It also allows us to know if our product is working in the way we intended, identify usability problems, and how to solve those problems. We had our participants(n=5) answer some questions and complete two tasks using our prototype. We began with background questions such as Do you use any websites or apps designed to keep track of food waste or ingredients? Do you manually keep track of food waste/ingredients? how often do you go grocery shopping? How much do you spend on each grocery trip on average? how many people are in your household? and if reducing food waste and keeping track of ingredient was something they been wanting to do. After the background questions, the first task our participants had to complete was adding an item to a table and finding an expired item to delete. Our second task was to update the information of an existing food item and find a soon to expire food item to delete. Though these tasks seem similar and simple, we gained valuable insights on how real-life users would complete these tasks because there were multiple ways of completing each task. We closed up the user testing with a few wrap-up questions. The wrap-up questions included Were there any moments where the website gave you troubles, and you could not figure out what to do?, Were there any features of the website that stood out to you or that you particularly liked? Are there any additional features you wished the website had? and Do you have any other thoughts or comments? Each user test took a maximum of 30 minutes and all participant information was condfidentail.
