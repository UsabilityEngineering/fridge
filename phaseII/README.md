# Phase II: Refining interaction and designing wireframes

By Karandeep Dhillon and Tamanna Haider for Team Fridge


# Methods
A **Cognitive Walkthrough** is a step-by-step approach to evaluating the usability of a product. Testers/users have a goal or task and try to accomplish it by interacting with wireframes. Wireframes are "screen blueprints" where all the functionality and pages that are going to be in that product are represented with their own page/slide in the wireframe. Wireframes help with the structure of the product and allow the software engineers to get an idea of everything the product needs to have and be able to do. At each step of the cognitive walkthrough, testers/users answer a series of questions. The questions are generally about if the user knows what to do at this step and does the user know he/she has made progress toward their goal. Cognitive walkthroughs help identify at which steps the testers/users were either lost on what to do or failed at accomplishing their goal. This gives feedback to the usability engineers on what they need to change in the wireframes before giving them to the software engineers. 

We also received **Informal Feedback** when our software engineers demoed the current state of the product to an audience that was primarily other software engineers. This allowed us to showcase the product and receive feedback on what we can change, improve, and add to our product to make it more compelling to our customers so we can have an advantage over our competitors. The audience presented us with new insights and questions regarding our product that we had not thought about before.
