# Phase I: Analyzing Users, Competitors, and Initial Designs

# Methods

Competitive analysis is mainly an assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of current competitors. Competitive analysis helps us identify our competitors, identify gaps in a certain business, and discovers standards across a business to market one's business more effectively. Competitive analysis can also identify the tactics used by our competitors and what separates each competitor apart. 

Heuristic evaluation is also mainly an assessment, but it involves measuring the usability of user interfaces and the product. The evaluators judge the product based on usually 5 to 10 heuristics and give a grade along with a description for each heuristic. Heuristic evaluations allow for an overall review of the usability of a product and discover gaps in the experience of using the application. Heuristic evaluations also help locate usability problems and allow for quick feedback even in the early design stages. 

Personas are realistic descriptions of a certain user of a product. Personas provide insight into understanding our user or typical users and help make a product that would be most effective for them. Scenarios describe a particular goal or task a specific user is wanting to accomplish. Scenarios provide insight into how and why a certain user or users would go about completing their goals/tasks using our product.
