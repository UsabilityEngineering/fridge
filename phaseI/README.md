# Phase I: Analyzing Users, Competitors, and Initial Designs


By Karandeep Dhillon and Tamanna Haider for Team Fridge


# Methods

Competitive analysis is mainly an assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of current competitors. Competitive analysis helps us identify our competitors, identify gaps in a certain business, and discovers standards across a business to market one's business more effectively. Competitive analysis can also identify the tactics used by our competitors and what separates each competitor apart. 

Heuristic evaluation is also mainly an assessment, but it involves measuring the usability of user interfaces and the product. The evaluators judge the product based on usually 5 to 10 heuristics and give a grade along with a description for each heuristic. Heuristic evaluations allow for an overall review of the usability of a product and discover gaps in the experience of using the application. Heuristic evaluations also help locate usability problems and allow for quick feedback even in the early design stages. 

Personas are realistic descriptions of a certain user of a product. Personas provide insight into understanding our user or typical users and help make a product that would be most effective for them. Scenarios describe a particular goal or task a specific user is wanting to accomplish. Scenarios provide insight into how and why a certain user or users would go about completing their goals/tasks using our product. 

# Findings
  **Competitve Analysis:**
*   There are two primary competitors and both are mobile apps, does not seem to have a primary web application competitor
*   Competitors are using a monthly subscription as the main source of revenue with also ad pop-ups for the free accounts
*   Competitors restrict certain access and limit the usage of certain tasks on free accounts as a way to encourage users to buy the subscription
*   Discovered a feature to plan the meals for the week as a journal entry to be something we can improve on 
*   Food items in the pantry seem to have no caloric or ingredient information, items only have an expiration date and quantity as the only information 

  **Hueristic Evalution:**
*   Improvements to be made on user control and freedom since certain parts are forced to be completed 
*   Application has too many things going on each tab/page 
*   To add to above point, there are a lot of different tasks crammed into a single tab/page, could be separated into different pages 
*   Application is not exactly minimal in design 
*   Application does follow a general theme and is slightly aesthetically pleasing
*   Application has great error prevention, error recognition, and erorr recovery
*   No real documentation of the app, but has really helpful pop-ups to complete tasks and a tour of the app when first opening the app was helpful
*   Gives options to connect with a number of stores but not all stores in the given options have the ability to connect 

  **Personas and Scenarios:**
*   Needs an effective way to budget and track expenses
*   Needs short recipes 
*   Food items need to have caloric and ingredient information
*   Needs recipes based on food items along with different types of dishes and recipe categories
*   Needs to indicate when a certain food item is about to expire


# Conclusions
 

# Caveats
  Our competitors are on the mobile platform while we plan to create our product on a web platform. Since people interact differently based on the platform they are on, bla blah.... 
  Our personas and scenarios did not involve much research and data gathering. They were primary created by our creativity and imagination so we can not rely heavily on our insights from personas and scenarios since they have a high probability of being inaccurate and even completely wrong.
