Chef Lily

Lily is a 46 year old mom in Charlotte, North Carolina. 

She works as a manager at Dillard’s in the jewelry department. Lily has taken some college courses but does not have any degrees.

Lily has been looking to change her job for quite a few years now but wants to continue to give her family stability. Her husband works at a drugstore as a certified pharmacy technician, and is in charge of a majority of the responsibilities. She has two children, Sophia and Carter, aged 15 and 12 respectively.

Lily spends her weekends either covering other people’s shifts or taking her kids out to the beach. Sophia and Carter spend a lot of time at extracurricular activities during the week, and are often too tired to spend time with their parents before bed. 

Although Lily’s family seems to be in a routine, they love to try new things on a budget. Sophia has her heart set on going out of state for college in a couple of years.

Goals:
Limit wasted money so she can avoid working overtime
Budget how much is spent on groceries monthly
Only buy what is needed to avoid being wasteful
