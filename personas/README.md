Her husband works at a drugstore as a certified pharmacy technician, and is in charge of a majority of the responsibilities. She has two children, Sophia and Carter, aged 15 and 12 respectively.

Lily spends her weekends either covering other people’s shifts or taking her kids out to the beach. Sophia and Carter spend a lot of time at extracurricular activities during the week, and are often too tired to spend time with their parents before bed.

# Scenarios

After her shift on Wednesday, Lily must pick up her kids from their afterschool activities, go home, and make dinner. On her long drive from work to her kids' schools, Lily finds herself stuck on what to make for dinner. It’s a hot day and she is too tired to cook, but doesn’t want to waste money on takeout. For the life of her, she can’t remember what groceries she has stocked at home and therefore can’t decide what would be best.


After an 1 hour and 30 minute workout in the gym, Bob is extremely hungry and ready to feast. He eats 4 meals a day. His go-to with the meal is a protein shake or water. Sometimes, he likes to drink a regular smoothie without much protein. He is currently on his third meal of the day and is clueless on what meal to make. He does not want to eat the same meal more than once a day so he is out of ideas by the third meal. He’s looking through his pantry and fridge and grabs from essential items he wants as a must. However, he noticed that two of the items had expired a week ago. He doesn’t know what he could make with these items. 


Angie is trying to develop a new menu for the coming week at her care home. She is not at the care home and doesn’t know what items are stocked up and what is running low. Her caregivers are also not the best cooks, they can follow recipes but they can’t create anything of their own. Angie is trying to find recipes online and cross-reference the ingredients lists in order to make a shopping list and make sure she stays under budget for this week’s shopping expenses. She doesn’t want to keep repeating the same food with her residents, but she might just have to keep repeating reliable menu items.
