# FRIDGE

Our project is called Fridge and it allows for users to track grocery items along with be presented with recipes. The problem we are trying to solve is that most people forget what grocery items they have and what recipes they can make with those items. Ultimately we want to help save them time from figuring what meals to cook and what grocery items are about to expire soon. Fridge application plans to help with this problem and help users waste less food by tracking all kinds of data on their grocery items. Fridge application tracks expiration dates, quantity of each item, price for budgeting, and also presents different kinds of recipes.

# Phase I: Analyzing Users, Competitors, and Initial Designs

**Executive Summary**

* Competitive analysis of competitors' product allowed us to discover that **information on each food item is limited to only the expiration date and quantity**. We can allow for each food item to store much more information such as calories and ingredients. We also found that **Free accounts are heavily restricted in what can be accomplished** and there is **no widely used competitor on a web-based platform.**
* Heuristic evaluation of competitor found **designs to be similar**, but **not exactly minimal** as **some tabs/pages have multiple purposes**. There is **opportunity to allow for user freedom and control.**
* Personas and Scenarios reveal the need to **focus on the core functionality**, **allow for budgeting/tracking expenses**, **remind users of soon-to-expire-foods**, and **recipes that are most relevant to the grocery items they have** 
* Sketches and Diagrams allowed for initial visuals of the interface with a **focus on minimal design** and **effectively navigating core content**

# Phase II: Refining interaction and designing wireframes

**Executive Summary**

* From our cognitive walkthrough, we discovered that our findings suggest  **medium to high fidelity** design with **improvements in user feedback**. 
* From our informal user feedback, we found users want the application to be as **automated and seamless as possible**. Users want a way to **add/subtract quantities of each food item** and be **notified of** grocery items that are **expiring soon or expired foods**.  
* Our findings **suggest adanvcements to our wireframes** by making changes to existing boards and adding more to **have more accurate prototypes** to our final product. Some scenarios were more easily accomplished than others.
